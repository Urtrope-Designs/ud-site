This app does not collect any user data. Period. There is no concept of an account or anything. Even configuration data is packaged with the app.

Your in-game data is stored locally on whatever device is running the app, so none of that can be tracked either. 

Seriously, there is nothing being tracked here. Relax and enjoy!
