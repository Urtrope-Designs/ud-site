This app does not collect any user data. Period. There is no concept of an account or anything. The game's configuration data is pulled from Firebase (which is a service owned by Google), but currently the same data is pulled from that service regardless of anything you can do in the app, so there is no concept of tracking usage data or anything.

Google Analytics is NOT turned on for this app. 

No cookies are being used. Seriously, open the web version of the app and check out dev tools. 

Your in-game data is stored locally on whatever device is running the app, so none of that can be tracked either. 

Seriously, there is nothing being tracked here. Relax and enjoy!
